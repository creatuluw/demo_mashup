# Demo Mashup
This is an experimental demo mashup. It is developed under the strict rules of learning. :) Meaning that a lot of code / techniques could have been better. Use this example for your own learning or to see how stuff can be better.

To install this mashup: just download the files in this repository. Copy them into your Qlik Sense extensions folder.

The app that serves as a source for this mashup can be found here:
https://github.com/creatuluw/salesdata_app, copy this app into your local Qlik Sense apps folder.

Then open your mashup editor @ http://localhost:4848/dev-hub/ (This is the address for Qlik Sense desktop only)

If you have any questions let me know.
